        <p>Communication is the process which involves all acts of transmitting message to channels which links to the languages and symbolic codes which are used to transmit such messages. It is the means by which such messages are received and stored. it includes the rules, customs and conventions, which defines and regulate human relationship and event. </p>
        <p>Communication is a common phenomenon that cuts across the daily activities of human life. Without communication man cannot survive because communication touches every sphere of human activity. It is as important as food and water are to man’s survival and it is fundamental to man’s daily living and existence. It informs all of man’s actions because it is induced by his need to interact with his fellow man. Though animals also communication, it is man’s ability to create symbols, assign meanings and interpret messages that elevates him above the status of animals and gives form and meaning to his existence.
           Communication also serves as an instrument of social interaction. It helps us to understand ourselves, to keep in touch with other people, to understand them, and to predict their response to situations. It is the medium through which relationships are established, extended and maintained. It provides a means by which people in business, politics and other professions act and interact, exchange information and ideas, develop plans, proposals and policies, make decision and manage men and materials. In business and industry, communication is the lubricant that keeps the machinery of the organization functioning; it is the means through 
           which roles are identified and assigned. It is the life-blood of an organization.
